# Transaction Categorization System Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design approach for implementing an interactive transaction categorization system with pattern-based rule suggestions.

## Core Components

### 1. Manual Categorization Interface
- Display one uncategorized transaction at a time
- Show key transaction details:
  - Description
  - Amount
  - Date
  - Current category (default: "uncategorized")
- Provide dropdown/selection for all available categories
- Include buttons for:
  - Confirm categorization
  - Skip transaction
  - Mark for review

### 2. Pattern Detection System

#### Pattern Analysis
When a transaction is manually categorized, analyze:
- Full description text
- Common substrings across similarly categorized transactions
- Numeric patterns (amounts, dates)
- Merchant names or identifiers
- Special characters or formatting

#### Rule Generation
Generate candidate rules based on:
- Exact matches (for consistent descriptions)
- Substring matches (for variable descriptions with common elements)
- Regular expressions (for complex patterns)
- Amount ranges (for consistent payment amounts)
- Combinations of the above

### 3. Rule Review Interface

#### Rule Presentation
For each suggested rule:
- Show the pattern detected
- Display sample transactions that would match
- Provide confidence score based on:
  - Number of matching transactions
  - Pattern specificity
  - Potential false positives

#### Rule Refinement
Allow users to:
- Accept rule as-is
- Modify pattern
- Reject rule
- Add conditions or exceptions
- Test rule against historical transactions

## Data Flow

1. **Initial State**
   - All new transactions start as "uncategorized"
   - Existing rules are applied to new transactions
   - Remaining uncategorized transactions await manual review

2. **Manual Categorization**
   - User reviews single transaction
   - Selects category
   - System stores categorization
   - Pattern detection is triggered

3. **Pattern Detection**
   - Analyze newly categorized transaction
   - Compare with other transactions in same category
   - Generate candidate rules
   - Calculate confidence scores

4. **Rule Review**
   - Present suggested rules to user
   - Show potential matches
   - Allow modification
   - Save approved rules

## Implementation Considerations

### Storage
- Transaction categories in database
- Rule definitions in structured format
- Pattern matching history for refinement

### Performance
- Batch pattern analysis for efficiency
- Cache common patterns
- Limit rule complexity for maintainability

### User Experience
- Clear feedback on rule matches
- Easy navigation between transactions
- Quick category selection
- Intuitive rule editing

### Edge Cases
- Handling of similar merchants
- Dealing with inconsistent formatting
- Managing rule conflicts
- Handling of special characters

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Machine learning integration for pattern detection
- Category suggestions based on transaction properties
- Bulk rule application
- Rule import/export
- Pattern detection analytics

### Monitoring
- Rule effectiveness tracking
- False positive monitoring
- Category distribution analytics
- User interaction metrics

## Technical Integration

### Existing Components
- Leverage current categorization module
- Integrate with Streamlit interface
- Use existing database structure
- Build on current rule engine

### New Components Needed
- Pattern detection engine
- Rule suggestion system
- Interactive review interface
- Rule testing framework

## Success Metrics

### Efficiency
- Reduction in manual categorization time
- Accuracy of suggested rules
- Rule application success rate
- Pattern detection precision

### Quality
- False positive rate
- Rule coverage
- Category consistency
- User satisfaction

## Next Steps

1. Implement basic manual categorization interface
2. Develop pattern detection system
3. Create rule suggestion mechanism
4. Build rule review interface
5. Integrate components
6. Test with real transaction data
7. Gather user feedback
8. Refine and optimize
